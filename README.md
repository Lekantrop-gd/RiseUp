I'm confident that most of you have guessed this simple but wonderful [game from Casual Azur Games]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game). I've decided to pay homage to it and to make my portfolio wider, so here it is: 

# [Rise Up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game) Clone 

### The development cycle included the following stages:
- ### Conceptualization:
  Usually on this stage developers generate and refine game ideas based on market trends, target audience, and creative inspiration.
  Also they analyze the competition and market trends to identify opportunities and potential pitfalls.  

  In this case we have complete and successful game made by [professionals](https://azurgames.com/),
  so now we just have to understand why this game is interesting for people and how we can rich the same effect. 

- ### Pre-production:
    - The first step of pre-production is creating a detailed design document outlining the game mechanics, characters, levels, story, and overall gameplay.
      Creating a full GDD for a game like [Rise Up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game) is a detailed and comprehensive task
      that typically involves multiple pages of documentation, so I didn’t include it here.
      
    -	Next step is prototyping (building a basic version or prototype of the game to test key features and concepts).
      That step is very import, because that is the point that defines if the game is worth to start development.
     	
    -	And the final step is to define on which platforms the game will release.
      In our case this step is very simple, since [Rise up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game) is a mobile game, so I decided to build it only for android platform.

-	### Development:
    Let’s move on to the next (my favorite) stage – development. Let my describe every development step.
 	
    -	Coding. I decided to develop a game with [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/), of course, and to use an [MVP architecture](https://unity.com/how-to/build-modular-codebase-mvc-and-mvp-programming-patterns#mvp-and-unity)
      to make the game more flexible and scalable. Also, I added composition root architecture layer which is responsible for DI (dependency injection).  
     	
    -	Art and Animation. All the graphics I’ve made by myself, referencing to the original [Rise Up]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game) design.
      
    -	Sound Design. The original [Rise Up]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseup.game) has it’s own calm and inspiration music which make you remember this game for a long time.
      I’m not a musician at all, so I just decided to get a music from the original game.
     	
    -	Testing. This step is last, but not least. During the testing I’ve fixed a lot of little bugs in the gameplay and UI, so never underestimate testing. ***Never.***

Common game development cycle consists of 4 more stages (Alpha and Beta Testing, polishing, launch and post-launch support) which I didn’t include because it’s not a commercial product, but just showcase of my skills).
